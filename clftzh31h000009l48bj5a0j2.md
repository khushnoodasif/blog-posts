Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that allows developers to define and provision infrastructure as code. It has become a popular tool in the DevOps and SRE community as it enables teams to automate infrastructure deployment and management. In this blog, we will discuss the benefits of using Terraform and how it can help DevOps/SRE engineers to streamline their workflow and achieve better infrastructure management.

### Benefits of Terraform

Terraform provides several key benefits for DevOps/SRE engineers, including:

### Infrastructure as Code

Terraform enables developers to define infrastructure as code, which means that they can use the same development practices on their infrastructure that they use on their application code. This provides several benefits, including version control, collaboration, testing, and automation.
