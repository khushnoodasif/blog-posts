If you are managing Kubernetes clusters, you might find yourself often using kubectl, the command-line tool for managing Kubernetes. While kubectl is a powerful tool, it can be a bit cumbersome to use, especially when managing complex Kubernetes resources. This is where k9s comes in.

K9s is a terminal-based CLI that provides a simplified and intuitive interface for managing Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to view, navigate, and manage Kubernetes resources with ease, making it an essential tool for developers and system administrators who need to work with Kubernetes.

Here are some of the key features of k9s:

1. Intuitive Navigation: With k9s, you can easily navigate your Kubernetes clusters using a simple and intuitive interface. You can use arrow keys to move around, and with just a few keystrokes, you can filter and search for specific resources.
