# Counting Lines Starting with 'a' in a Text File using Python

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Python program to count all the lines in a text file that start with the letter 'a'. Let's get started with the code. If you find this article helpful, please consider sharing it with your coding communities and social media groups so that others can benefit from the content as well.

To begin, we need to open the text file in read mode using Python. In this example, we are using a text file called "content.txt" which is located in the same directory as the Python file. We can open the file by simply providing its name, or by specifying the complete file path if it is located elsewhere. Here is the code to open the file in read mode:

```python
with open("content.txt") as f:
```

Next, we will create a variable called `count_a` to keep track of the number of lines that start with the letter 'a'. We will initialize this variable to 0 and increment it by 1 every time we encounter a line that starts with 'a'.

```python
count_a = 0
```

Now, we will iterate through the file using a for loop. As we iterate through the file, each line will be stored in the variable `line`. We will then check whether the first character of the line (at index 0) is the letter 'a' (in lowercase). If it is, we will increment the `count_a` variable by 1.

```python
for line in f:
    if line[0].lower() == "a":
        count_a += 1
```

Finally, we will print out the value of the `count_a` variable to see the total number of lines that start with 'a'.

```python
print("No of lines starting with a = ", count_a)
```

Here is the complete source code for this program:

```python
with open("content.txt") as f:
    count_a = 0
    
    for line in f:
        if line[0].lower() == "a":
            count_a += 1

print("No of lines starting with a = ", count_a)
```

I hope this code and explanation are helpful in understanding how to count lines starting with 'a' in a text file using Python. Thank you for reading!
