# Counting the Number of Rows in a CSV File with Python

n this tutorial, you will learn how to write a Python program that reads a CSV file and displays the number of rows in it. We will be using the csv module to read the file and iterate through it to count the number of rows. Let's get started with the code.

To read a CSV file and count the number of rows in it, we will follow these steps:

1.  Import the csv module.
    

```python
import csv
```

2.  Open the CSV file in read mode. In this example, we are using the file "test.csv".
    

```python
with open("test.csv","r") as f:
```

3.  Create a reader object to read the file. Also, define a variable called `count` with an initial value of 0 to count the number of rows.
    

```python
f_reader = csv.reader(f)
count = 0
```

4.  Iterate through the rows in the reader object. For each row, increment the `count` variable by 1.
    

```python
for row in f_reader:
    count += 1
```

5.  Print out the value of the `count` variable to see the number of rows in the CSV file.
    

```python
print("Number of rows = ", count)
```

Here is the complete code for this program:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file in read mode
with open("test.csv","r") as f:
    # Create a reader object to read the file
    f_reader = csv.reader(f)
    # Define a variable called 'count' with an initial value of 0 to count the number of rows
    count = 0
    # Iterate through the rows in the reader object
    for row in f_reader:
        # Increment the 'count' variable by 1 for each row
        count += 1

# Print out the number of rows in the CSV file
print("Number of rows = ", count)
```

Running this code will result in the following output:

```python
Number of rows = 6
```

I hope this code and explanation are helpful in understanding how to read a CSV file and display the number of rows in it using Python. Thank you for reading!
